When I was a young boy,
I was scared of growing up
I didn't understand it, but I was terrified of love
Felt like I had to choose, but it was outta my control
I needed to be saved, I was going crazy on my own
It took me years to tell my mother
I expected the worst
I gathered all the courage in the world
